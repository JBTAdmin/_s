<!--If you want to know how Wordpress chooses specific files based on category/ single post/ single page look below URL-->
https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/

Bullet Points:

    1- WordPress uses the header comment section of a style.css to display information about the theme in the Appearance (Themes) dashboard panel.
    2- Wordpress has different post types (Music, Quote...). Though all posts will be stored in the same tables (wp_posts). Column post_type
    in given tables define the post types. Apart from existing post types. Custom post types can also be created.

    3- Template files are used to display specific type of Post types. Certain Post Types are tied to certain template files
    4- Default Post types
        Post (‘post’)
        Page (‘page’)
        Attachment (‘attachment’)
        Revision (‘revision’)
        Navigation menu (‘nav_menu_item’)

    5- Template files where POST will be displayed
        single.php and single-post.php
        category.php
        tag.php
        taxonomy.php
        archive.php
        author.php
        date.php
        search.php
        home.php
        index.php

    6- Template files where PAGES will be displayed
        page.php
        $custom.php
        front-page.php
        search.php
        index.php

    7- WP Requires minimum two files (index.php & style.css). header and footer.php might also be required. style.css should always be in
       root folder and not in css folder.

    8- For the standard folder structure look for tweenty-tweenty theme.

    9- WP uses query-string to determine template files to be used for specific page. There is a template hierarchy which will be
       traversed by the Wordpress to determine template file to use.

    10- To know more details on how specific template file is selected for given link / page.
        Go to - https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/#the-template-hierarchy-in-detail

    11- TEMPLATE TAGS -- Template tags are kind of reusable component which can be used in different parts of Themes to display some data
        or include some files. A template tag is simply a piece of code that tells WordPress to get something from the database. It is broken up into three components:
        1- A PHP code tag
        2- A WordPress function
        3- Optional parameters

Example of the template tags
    1- get_header() : Default - header.php
        get_header(custom) : header-custom.php
    2- get_footer() : footer.php
        get_footer('custom') : footer-custom.php
    3- get_sidebar() : sidebar.php
        get_sidebar('custom') : sidebar-custom.php

    4- the_title()
    5- bloginfo()
    6- wp_list_cats()
    7- wp_list_pages()

Some of template tags that need to be inside of the loop include
    1- the_content()
    2- the_excerpt()
    3- next_post()
    4- previous_post()

12- WordPress creates pages by assembling various files. Aside from the standard files for the header, footer and sidebar,
you can create custom template files and call them at any location in the page using get_template_part().

If you have created a template file named PRODUCT.PHP to handle product content type and then you want specific handling for those
product with category as beauty, you can create a template file names PRODUCT-BEAUTY.PHP. and this template files can be loaded
using method
get_template_part( 'product', 'beauty' );

13- The proper way to add scripts and styles to your theme is to enqueue them in the functions.php files.
wp_enqueue_style( 'style', get_stylesheet_uri() );

wp_enqueue_script( $handle, $src, $deps, $ver, $in_footer);
$handle is the name for the script.
$src defines where the script is located.
$deps is an array that can handle any script that your new script depends on, such as jQuery.
$ver lets you list a version number.
$in_footer is a boolean parameter (true/false) that allows you to place your scripts in the footer of your HTML document
rather then in the header, so that it does not delay the loading of the DOM tree.

14- Conditional Tags / Conditional Function / Boolean Function :  which will be used inside if condition.

1- What is slug template or slug argument??

Important Methods in Wordpress


#yarn vs npm
Yarn is a superset of NPM that solves many problems that NPM has.
Yarn is a package manager that uses NPM registry as its backend.

#webpack vs gulp vs grunt vs browserify
https://alligator.io/tooling/webpack-gulp-grunt-browserify/


**Package Manager**
PHP : Composer
Python : PIP/Pipenv
Java : Maven/ Gradle
Node : NPM/YARN

??:https://laracasts.com/??

**Babel is a JS transpiler that converts new JS code into old ones.

**Webpack
Different steps like
    1- SASS Pre-Compiler
    2- Post Processing for Auto Prefixing
    3- Using Babel to provide backward compile JS code
    4- Minify and uglify the CSS and JS code.

All the things can be done with a tool called WEBPACK with a file called WEBPACK.CONFIG.JS
Command : webpack

npm run build
npm run buildprod


Webpack has two parts
i-  Loaders : First 3 can be done with it.
ii- Plugins (Core to webpack) : Other things that can not be done with Loaders can be done with plugins.

    21. Aria Navigation : https://codeable.io/wordpress-accessibility-creating-accessible-dropdown-menus/
    22. UL and LI element is not properly aligned. Look for other elements too.                                             (Medium Issue***)
    23. Look for other section that needs to be changed a but like navigation for blog posts on home and other archive pages.

    they are having some class named 'header-toggles hide-no-js'. Need to investigate further.
    32. Need to add the minified version of JS and CSS. Not sure if it should be through customizer or just adding it will work.
    33. When Sidebar Alt is not available or there is no widget assigned to that sidebar. Do not display hamburger menu.
    34. Look for footer layout inspired by GO. It should be unique.
    35. In case there is no Widget in Sidebar Alt. Hamburger Menu should not be displayed and even in that case for mobile screen sidebar Alt should be enabled
        and Main menu should be there.
    36. On this page : http://localhost:10013/tag/aside/#menu is going below the article's name. z-index is not working.
